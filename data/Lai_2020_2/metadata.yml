  description: Twig traits collection led by Hao Ran Lai during PhD with Michiel
    van Breugel and Hugh Tiang Wah Tan at the National University of Singapore
    and Yale-NUS College. Later, Zhongyu Chiam was mentored by Hao Ran Lai to 
    collect more twig wood traits.
  basis_of_record: unknown
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: Opportunistic twig sampling, mostly around Mandai Forest in
    Singapore. Twigs were mostly ensured to be about 1-cm in diameter. Density
    was measured using the water displacement method after oven drying.
  original_file: unknown
  notes: basis_of_record is mostly from field, but may contain some street trees
    and experimental plantings.

- var_in: WD_twig

  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: usually 1 and some had more
  methods: For each tree, three main twigs and three terminal twigs as obtained 
    from three different branches. The collection of main twigs was standardised 
    to 1–2 cm in diameter while terminal twigs, defined as the last point of 
    ramification on a branch, were mostly collected at <0.3 cm in diameter.
    By the means of ater displacement 
    (Swenson & Enquist 2008; Pérez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013), 
    the fresh volume of the twig was measured. Twig samples were then dried in 
    the oven at 70°C for a week until the weight was stable before measuring 
    their dry weight.

  entity_type: individual

  replicates: 3
  methods: For both main and terminal twigs, the bark was removed before 
    measuring the twig diameter using a digimatic calliper (Absolute digimatic 
    calliper CD-6 CS, Mitutoyo). To enhance measurement accuracy, twig diameter 
    was measured three times to obtain the average. The diameter of the 
    heartwood or the pith, when present, was also measured. All piths were 
    removed before the fresh weight of the twig was measured.
