  methods: Wherever available, the life forms provided in the checklists of 
    Turner (1995b) were used. Life forms and growth habits in the 
    LegumeWeb database, the Kew World Checklists, the PIER database 
    (US Forest Service, Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk, 2008) and 
    the e-PROSEA (e-PROSEA, undated) were also referred to. 
    Life forms of Raunkjaer (1936) used in the Kew World Checklists are 
    adapted thus hydrophytes, geophytes and hemicryptophytes were treated 
    as herbs, nanophanerophytes were considered shrubs and 
    phanerophytes, as trees.
