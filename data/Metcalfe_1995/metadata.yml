  methods: Seeds and fruits were collected between March 1992 and
    September 1993. Sampling was haphazard and often limited to collection
    from a single fruiting individual. 
    No bias in terms of the size of seed or fruit collected was employed. 
    A minimum of 10 seeds was collected for each species (minimum of 100 for 
    species of mean seed dry mass < 1 mg), except in the cases of Anisoptera costata 
    and Uvaria leptopoda (6 only). All seeds were cleaned and then dried for 
    48 h at 80°C; dry mass values were determined for single seeds or known 
    numbers of seeds on an electronic balance to a precision of 0.1 mg. 
    The values quoted have been rounded off to two significant figures.
