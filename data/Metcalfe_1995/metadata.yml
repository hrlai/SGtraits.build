  sampling_strategy: Seeds and fruits were collected between March 1992 and
    September 1993. Sampling was haphazard and often limited to collection
    from a single fruiting individual. 
    No bias in terms of the size of seed or fruit collected was employed. 
    A minimum of 10 seeds was collected for each species (minimum of 100 for 
    species of mean seed dry mass < 1 mg), except in the cases of 
    Anisoptera costata and Uvaria leptopoda (6 only).

  notes: Voucher specimens for most species are lodged at the Botany Department 
    herbarium, National University of Singapore (SINU). Nomenclature for 
    species follows Whitmore (1972b) and Turner et al. (1990) for Singapore 
    and Ashton (1968) and Whitmore (1975) for Brunei and Sarawak.

  methods: All seeds were cleaned and then dried for 
    48 h at 80°C; dry mass values were determined for single seeds or known 
    numbers of seeds on an electronic balance to a precision of 0.1 mg. 
    The values quoted have been rounded off to two significant figures.
