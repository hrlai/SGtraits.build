  methods: These tests were done using a concave
    punching rod. The tests were conducted with the FLS-1 mechanical tester. First leaf
    thickness at the punch position was measured with a micro meter. Next the leaf was
    mounted in the FLS-1 and primary and secondary veins were avoided when
    positioning the sample. Then the leaf was punched in a first pass, with the sample still
    in place a second pass was done to take friction into account in the calculations. The
    maximum force to punch the leaf was registered by a 50N load cell and divided by the
    punch-rod circumference (6.09469 mm circumference, with a diameter of 1.94 mm)
    to normalize per fracture length and to determine Fp in N mm-1. We used the
    circumference as normalization, following the method of Onoda et al. (2011), which
    explains that circumference is used rather than the punch area because data
    calculations that use the area tend to be very sensitive to the size of the diameter.

  methods: Total work to fracture lamina was measured with the shearing method
    developed by Lucas and Pereira (Lucas & Pereira, 1990). The outer edge of the leaf,
    the leaf margin, was cut off so the ‘least-tough path’ could be measured. First an
    empty pass with no leaf in position was done, to obtain the amount of force caused by
    friction of the scissor, and this was later subtracted from the second pass. Next the
    scissors of the FLS-1 were placed in an angle of 60-90° at the midrib, parallel to
    secondary veins. In general this least-tough path, avoiding the secondary veins, was
    followed when the leaf was cut in a single continuous movement. The shearing force
    was recorded during this second pass with a 50N load cell and plotted against cut
    distance, which was recorded simultaneously, to obtain a force-displacement curve
    for each lamina piece. Total work to fracture (J) was calculated for the lamina, and is
    further noted as fracture toughness. Leaf work to shear is then fracture toughness 
    divided by cut length. Although we avoided secondary veins when
    measuring fracture toughness, fine veins were unavoidable.
