  description: This dataset originated from Rens Brouwer who visited Michiel van Breugel 
    at Yale-NUS College for an undergraduate study. The assistant team was part of the
    lab group back then. The main project measures a set of leaf toughness traits using
    equipments built by Peter Lucas.

  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: In total 27 different dicotyledonous angiosperms species 
    were selected out of 41 candidate species for this research. Species were 
    selected on their common abundance in Singapore; all are abundant species 
    in disturbed, secondary forest, areas in Singapore. Furthermore the species
    were chosen to represent a wide range of leaf characteristics. 
    Identification was done in the field or in the laboratory with the help
    of Hao Ran Lai. Leaves were collected in Singapore from tropical secondary 
    forests at Mandai, Kent Ridge and the tree collection on the campus of the 
    National University of Singapore and Yale-NUS College. The location where 
    the measurements took place and where the leaves were processed was the 
    NERI-Yale-NUS laboratory. The sampling and measurement methodology of this 
    study followed largely the protocols of Pérez-Harguindeguy et al. (2013) 
    Leaf samples were generally collected between 8:00am and 12:00am. 
    Only foliage growing in full sun, so called sun leaves, was selected 
    for sampling, usually from a height of 2-6 m. For some understory species 
    (e.g. Clidemia hirta, and Cinnamomum iners) it was difficult to collect 
    sun leaves, so in some cases shade leaves were measured. Leaves and twigs
    were placed in sealed plastic bags with moist tissue paper to minimize 
    ranspiration during collection and transport. Usually samples were tested 
    that same day, or at least within 24 hours of collection. Leaves waiting 
    for measurements and processing were stored at a temperature of 4°C, 
    in plastic bags with some water to get them fully (re)-hydrated. 
    For all trait measurements, young-to-medium aged but fully expanded and
    hardened leaves without obvious symptoms of pathogens or herbivory, or 
    a substantial cover of epiphylls were selected. Maturity was assessed 
    in terms of colour, lamina thickness, manually determined texture and 
    position on shoot. Traits were measured on a minimal of six individuals 
    per species and on eight leaves per plant for leaf toughness and on 
    three individuals per species and two leaves per plant for leaf morphology.

  methods: These tests were done using a concave
    punching rod. The tests were conducted with the FLS-1 mechanical tester. First leaf
    thickness at the punch position was measured with a micro meter. Next the leaf was
    mounted in the FLS-1 and primary and secondary veins were avoided when
    positioning the sample. Then the leaf was punched in a first pass, with the sample still
    in place a second pass was done to take friction into account in the calculations. The
    maximum force to punch the leaf was registered by a 50N load cell and divided by the
    punch-rod circumference (6.09469 mm circumference, with a diameter of 1.94 mm)
    to normalize per fracture length and to determine Fp in N mm-1. We used the
    circumference as normalization, following the method of Onoda et al. (2011), which
    explains that circumference is used rather than the punch area because data
    calculations that use the area tend to be very sensitive to the size of the diameter.

  methods: Total work to fracture lamina was measured with the shearing method
    developed by Lucas and Pereira (Lucas & Pereira, 1990). The outer edge of the leaf,
    the leaf margin, was cut off so the ‘least-tough path’ could be measured. First an
    empty pass with no leaf in position was done, to obtain the amount of force caused by
    friction of the scissor, and this was later subtracted from the second pass. Next the
    scissors of the FLS-1 were placed in an angle of 60-90° at the midrib, parallel to
    secondary veins. In general this least-tough path, avoiding the secondary veins, was
    followed when the leaf was cut in a single continuous movement. The shearing force
    was recorded during this second pass with a 50N load cell and plotted against cut
    distance, which was recorded simultaneously, to obtain a force-displacement curve
    for each lamina piece. Total work to fracture (J) was calculated for the lamina, and is
    further noted as fracture toughness. Leaf work to shear is then fracture toughness 
    divided by cut length. Although we avoided secondary veins when
    measuring fracture toughness, fine veins were unavoidable.
