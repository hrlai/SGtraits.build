  description: Traits collected during the undergraduate honours study of 
    Germaine Su Yin Tan, mentored by Hao Ran Lai.
  basis_of_record: unknown
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: Trait collection in the field was carried out from May 2015 to 
    January 2017 following the standard protocols in Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 
    (2013). For leaf trait measurements, we collected three mature sun leaves 
    from 1 to 10 (mean = 5) individual plants to measure SLA, LDMC, and LTh. 
    Leaf traits were all derived from the lamina (excluding the petiole and 
    rachis). Twig wood was opportunistically collected mostly around Mandai 
    Forest, Kent Ridge and NUS. Twigs were mostly ensured to be about 1-cm in 
    diameter. Density was measured using the water displacement method after 
    oven drying.
  original_file: unknown
  notes: basis_of_record is mostly from field, but may contain some street trees
    and experimental plantings.
