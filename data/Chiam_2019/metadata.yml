  description: Undergraduate honours project of Zhongyu Chiam, part of an
    experiment to measure PM deposition on leaves.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Plant materials were collected from the National University
    of Singapore Kent Ridge Campus and Central Catchment Nature Reserve. A total 
    of twenty tropical plant species spanning across 16 families were selected. 
    Plant species were selected based on the four criteria - lamina roughness, 
    lamina hairiness, average leaf area and SLA - to allow for a good coverage 
    of each leaf trait. For each species, three mature individual trees were 
    sampled, totalling of 60 individuals. From each individual, 400-500 cm2 
    of mature leaves were collected. To preserve the moisture and integrity of 
    each batch, leaves were sealed in resealable plastic bags upon collection 
    and immediately stored in the refrigerator upon returning to the laboratory. 
    All leaves were processed in the laboratory within 24 hours of collection 
    as they may be susceptible to water loss.

  methods: For each species, three mature plants were sampled 
    (60 individuals in total). From each individual, 400--500 cm2 of 
    mature leaves were collected for the wind-tunnel experiment. 
    To preserve moisture and integrity, leaves were sealed in resealable 
    plastic bags upon collection and immediately stored in the 
    refrigerator upon returning to the laboratory. 
    All leaves were processed in the laboratory within 24 h of collection.
