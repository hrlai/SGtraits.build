  methods: For each species, three mature plants were sampled 
    (60 individuals in total). From each individual, 400--500 cm2 of 
    mature leaves were collected for the wind-tunnel experiment. 
    To preserve moisture and integrity, leaves were sealed in resealable 
    plastic bags upon collection and immediately stored in the 
    refrigerator upon returning to the laboratory. 
    All leaves were processed in the laboratory within 24 h of collection.
