  description: Leaf traits collection led by Hao Ran Lai during PhD with Michiel
    van Breugel and Hugh Tiang Wah Tan at the National University of Singapore
    and Yale-NUS College.
  basis_of_record: unknown
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: The collection of traits in the study site was carried out 
    during May 2015–January 2017 following standard protocols in 
    Perez-Harguindeguy et al. (2013). For leaf traits, we collected three mature
    sun leaves from 1 to 10 (median = 6) individual plants to measure SLA, LDMC
    and LTh. For strictly understorey species, we collected the shade leaves. 
    Leaf traits were all derived from the lamina, excluding the petiole and 
    rachis.
  original_file: unknown
  notes: basis_of_record is mostly from field, but may contain some street trees
    and experimental plantings.
