  description: Undergraduate honours project by Amanda Ng under the supervision
    of Hugh Tiang Wah Tan, in collaboration with Alex Thiam Koon Yee (NParks) 
    and mentored by Hao Ran Lai. The aim is to correlate traits to species
    shade tolerance under the Kepple Viaduct plantings.
  basis_of_record: field_experiment
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: Leaves of species grown in shade were collected from 
    HortPark, the National University of Singapore (NUS) Kent Ridge Campus 
    Science Drive 4, and the National Parks Board Pasir Panjang Nursery 
    between 0800 hours and 1100 hours. Leaves collected were young, 
    fully expanded, fully developed leaves from adult plants and had to still 
    be attached to the twig (Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013). Leaves selected 
    for measurement and collection were not subjected to herbivory. 
    The samples were sealed in a zip-lock bag containing water, with the 
    cut-end of each branch submerged in water, before bringing back to the
    laboratory for further measurements.

traits:
- var_in: Area_mm2
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: usually 3
  methods: Within 24 hours of collection, the fresh weight of each individual 
    leaf was measured to an accuracy of 0.001g. The fresh weights of the 
    petiole and lamina were measured separately. Petiole and lamina were 
    measured separately so that SLA can be calculated based just on the 
    lamina, or lamina with petiole.
- var_in: LDMC
  unit_in: mg/mg
  trait_name: leaf_dry_matter_content
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: usually 3
  methods: The LDMC for each lamina and petiole was calculated by dividing its 
    respective dry weight (mg) by its respective fresh weight (g).  
- var_in: SLA
  unit_in: mm2/mg
  trait_name: leaf_mass_per_area
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: usually 3
  methods: Within 24 hours of collection, the fresh weight of each individual 
    leaf was measured to an accuracy of 0.001g. The fresh weights of the 
    petiole and lamina were measured separately. Petiole and lamina were 
    measured separately so that SLA can be calculated based just on the 
    lamina, or lamina with petiole. Each leaf lamina and petiole were then 
    gently pressed under a piece of glass in a flatbed scanner (HP Scanjet 
    G4050 Photo Scanner, USA) and scanned at 300 dots per inch (dpi). 
    Image processing software ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012) was used to 
    calculate the area of each lamina and petiole in pixels. The area in pixels 
    was then converted to mm2. Once the area measurement was done, the laminas 
    and petioles were placed in paper bags and into a drying oven for at least 
    72 hours at 70°C to be dried to a stable weight before measuring the dry 
    weight to an accuracy of 0.001 g. The SLA of the lamina and for the petiole 
    was calculated by dividing each lamina and each petiole area by their 
    respective dry weight (mm2 g-1). 
- var_in: Th
  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: leaf_thickness
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: usually 3
  methods: Lth was then measured at three standardised positions along each 
    lamina --- base, middle, and tip, using a Mitutoyo micrometer (Mitutoyo 
    Corporation, Japan). Lth, expressed in mm, is taken to be the average of 
    the three values measured. This allows for greater accuracy of measurement. 
- var_in: SC
  unit_in: mmol{H2O}/m2/s
  trait_name: leaf_stomatal_conductance_per_area_ambient
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 5
  methods: For each species, stomatal conductance of five healthy, 
    fully developed leaves of from five different adult individual 
    plants grown under shade were measured and collectedand recorded 
    (SC-1, Decagon Devices Inc, Pullman, Washington, USA).
